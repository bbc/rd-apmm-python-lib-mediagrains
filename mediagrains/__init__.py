"""\
Library for handling media grains in pure python.

The library contains the functions: Grain, VideoGrain, CodedVideoGrain,
AudioGrain, CodedAudioGrain, and EventGrain as well as the module gsf.

The individual functions document their useage.

The classes returned from the functions are fully useable as if they were a
tuple:

(meta, data)

where "meta" is a dictionary containing grain metadata in a standard format,
and "data" is a bytes-like object. When the various constructor functions
are used in a way that constructs a new data element they will construct a
bytearray object of the apropriate size. Remember that in Python 2 bytes-like
objects are stringlike, but in Python 3 they resemble sequences of integers.

Notably this means that the data element of these grains is fully compatible
with numpy and similar libraries.

The gsf and grains submodules have their own documentation.
