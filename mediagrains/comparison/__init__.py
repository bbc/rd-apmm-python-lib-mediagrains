"""\
The submodule which gives comparison capabilities.

Contains a fairly complex set of methods for comparing grains in ways that
are more nuanced than the simple equality comparison provided by the grain class
itself.

The main interface is via the compare_grain function.

    Compare two grains.

    :param a: the first grain
    :param b: the second grain
    :param *options: Additional arguments are options to pass to this comparison. Currently only two types of options
    are supported: options.Exclude.<attribute name> causes the named attribute to be excluded from the comparison.
    Whereas for integer and timestamp attributes it is also possible to use a second type of option:
    options.ExpectedDifference.<attribute_name> == <value> (or >=, <, <=, >, !=) will set a criteria for succesful
    comparison on that attribute that is less strict that the standard requirement that the values be equal to each
    other.

    Eg.

    compare(a, b, options.Exclude.data, options.ExpectedDifference.sync_timestamp >= TimeOffset(64, 0))

    will compare the grains, ignoring differences in their data payloads, but requiring that instead of being equal the
    difference between their sync_timestamps must be greater than or equal to 64 seconds.

    :return: an object which is truthy if the comparison matched and falsy if it didn't, in addition the object has a
    detailed human readable summary of the differences between the grains obrainable by calling str on it. In addition
    any access to an attribute of this object that is possessed by grains (eg. .creation_timestamp, .data, .length)
    will provide another object that behaves similarly but represents only that attribute and any attributes/entries it
    contains. Each such object at any level in the tree can be tested as a boolean and can also have .excluded() called
    on it, which will return True iff the original comparison excluded that attribute.

    By default all comparisons ignore differences in creation_timestamp, to force this timestamp to be checked use the
    options.Include.creation_timestamp option.

    """
    Compare two iterators which produce grains pairwise. Each grain from iterator a will be compared against the
    corresponding grain in iterator b. The comparison will end when any grain fails to match. If one iterator runs out
    of grains the comparison will end. If both run out at the same time and all grains matches then this is considered
    a succesful match, any other situation is an unsuccessful match.

    :param a: An iterator that generates grains
    :param b: An iterator that generates grains
    :param return_last_only: Set to True to return only the description of the last comparison, instead of all
                             comparisons performed. If False, all compared Grains will be retained, which may require
                             significant memory if the Grain iterators are long.
    :param *options: Additional arguments are passed to the grain comparison mechanism exactly as for compare_grains.

    :returns: An object which will evaluate as True if the iterators matched, and False if they did not. In addition it
    has a rich description of the comparisons performed which is accesstible by calling str on it. A call to
    first_failing_index() will return the index of the first entry that does not match. The object itself is an ordered
    container containing matcher objects representing the differences between the grains, and these can be accessed via
    the standard [n] index notation, and len() will return the number of such result objects are present.

    By default all comparisons ignore differences in creation_timestamp, to force this timestamp to be checked use the
    options.Include.creation_timestamp option.
